# python
A mega repository with all Python programs I've ever made. 

This has a bunch of basic programs that I made a super long time ago, a few games here and there, and then some ML stuff.

I chose to learn Python because my degree is in Maths, and I'm very interested in doing something in the data field.
Be it data analytics, data science or even business intelligence, I know I want to play around with data in some form.
