# python
A mega repository with all Python programs I've ever made. 

This was made on 1st October, 2023. I came across a random video about tech placements and the like, and decided to revive my coding career.

I had taken part in the Google Code-in back in 2018 and 2019, but sort of gave up on coding after. 

This is an attempt to get back, starting with Python.

I chose Python because it's a high-level language, and is also used in various other applications. Plus with AI/ML picking up pace, I decided to jump on the bandwagon as well.
